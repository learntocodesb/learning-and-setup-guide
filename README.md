## Recommended Learning Resources

### Katas

Code Katas are a great way to improve your chops and improve specific coding techniques.

- [cyber-dojo.org](http://cyber-dojo.org/) is an excellent resource for practicing TDD and other skills. It's a bit ugly, but you can edit code directly in [Atom](https://atom.io/) with the [cyber dojo atom package](https://atom.io/packages/cyber-dojo)! Highly recommended.
- There are lots of great videos of people doing katas at [codekatas.org](http://www.codekatas.org/)
